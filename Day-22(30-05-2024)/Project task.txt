Why Should We Use JDBC

Before JDBC, ODBC API was the database API to connect and execute the query with the database. But, ODBC API uses ODBC driver which is written in C language (i.e. platform dependent and unsecured). That is why Java has defined its own API (JDBC API) that uses JDBC drivers (written in Java language).

We can use JDBC API to handle database using Java program and can perform the following activities:

Connect to the database
Execute queries and update statements to the database
Retrieve the result received from the database.

What is API
API (Application programming interface) is a document that contains a description of all the features of a product or software. It represents classes and interfaces that software programs can follow to communicate with each other. An API can be created for applications, libraries, operating systems, etc.
