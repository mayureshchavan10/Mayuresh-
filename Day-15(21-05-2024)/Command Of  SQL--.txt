1.Data Definition Language (DDL)
 ---------------------------------------------------
          DDL changes the structure of the table like creating a table, deleting a table, altering a table, etc.
          All the command of DDL are auto-committed that means it permanently save all the changes in the database.

    Here are some commands that come under DDL:

       CREATE
       ALTER
       DROP
       TRUNCATE

2.Data Manipulation Language(DML)
   -------------------------------------------------
         DML commands are used to modify the database. It is responsible for all form of changes in the database.
         The command of DML is not auto-committed that means it can't permanently save all the changes in the database. They can be rollback.

 Here are some commands that come under DML:

    INSERT
    UPDATE
    DELETE

 Syntax:

   INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME    
         (col1, col2, col3,.... col N)  
                      VALUES (value1, value2, value3, .... valueN);  
Or

  INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME    
             VALUES (value1, value2, value3, .... valueN);    

3.Data Control Language(DCL)
   ---------------------------------------------------------
       DCL commands are used to grant and take back authority from any database user.

    Here are some commands that come under DCL:
       Grant
       Revoke
a. Grant: It is used to give user access privileges to a database.

Example


b. Revoke: It is used to take back permissions from the user.

Example

REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE ON MY_TABLE FROM USER1, USER2;  

4. Transaction Control Language(TCL)
   -----------------------------------------------------
         TCL commands can only use with DML commands like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE only.

  Here are some commands that come under TCL:

     COMMIT
     ROLLBACK
     SAVEPOINT

          a. Commit: Commit command is used to save all the transactions to the database.

   Syntax:

   COMMIT;  

Example:

DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS  
WHERE AGE = 25;  
COMMIT;  
b. Rollback: Rollback command is used to undo transactions that have not already been saved to the database.
